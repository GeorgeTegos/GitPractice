# Workout Buddy

## MVP

Create a web app that allows someone to see a list of moves for their workout. Each Exercise should have a name, number of reps and number of sets. 

The user should be able to create an exercise, edit or delete it, and mark an exercise as completed as they do their workout.

## Extensions:

- Display completed and uncompleted exercises in two different lists on the same page.
- Give a motivational message every time a user marks an exercise as completed!
- Create an additional class of Workout, instances of which have a name e.g. “Leg Day” and a list of associated exercises. When the user lands on the homepage they can choose which workout they want to do.
